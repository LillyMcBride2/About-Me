    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Hello! My name is Lilly. I like to make ceramics at the Cherry
        building in Cedar Rapids. My pit bull's name is Todo and we 
        frquently go to the dog park. I currently work at Jimmy Johns 
        as a delivery driver and before that I worked as a driver for 
        Uber.
        </li>
        <li>I went to Washington Highschool in Cedar Rapids and after that 
        attended Kirkwood Community College, also in Cedar Rapids. I am
        now a student at DeltaV Code School in Cedar Rapids learning
        front end web development.

        My goals include landing a job as a developer at a non profit, 
        moving to the west coast, and adopting more dogs.
